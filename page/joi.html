        <h2>Digital reflection tool for Child Protection social workers</h2>
        <h6>Problem statement</h6>
        <p>Due to the increased workload of CP social workers, they hardly get to self-reflecting. Also, the
          obstruction
          caused by current reflecting tools are experienced as time consuming and not insightful. These methods
          consist
          of booklet paper forms (known as the case-note) being used during supervisions. However, in the current
          state
          due to the high demanded workload reflecting is not prioritized.</p>
        <h6>Solution</h6>
        <p>Joi provides insights for the CP social workers on troubled situations after consults with families, in
          order
          to reflect quickly and insightfully on their actions. This works through an application that makes it
          possible
          to record audio clips and via sensors - smartwatch to measure stress that occurs during a counsel. With this
          collected data, they can quickly contribute input during supervisions with their collegues, supervisors or
          experts.</p>

            <h6>1. Recording</h6>
            <p>During a recording the user is wearing a smartwatch that is connected via bluetooth. The smartwatch
              measures stressmoments during a counsel to quickly gain insights. It measures through sensors in the
              smartwatch, using heart rhythm variation.

          <h3>Target group</h3>
          <p>Social workers specialized in child protection (CP social workers) are responsible for helping broken
            families. They map out where the bottlenecks within the family lies and seeks for the right help. Their goal
            is ensuring welfare and wellbeing of the children.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="alinea">
          <h3>Interview insights</h3>
          <p>Through prior desk research we discovered that CP social workers have several tools including reflecting
            tools they apply on their job. Here are the insights about CP social workers:
            <ul class="bulletpoints">
              <li>The current tools they apply are seen as time consuming and outdated</li>
              <li>High demanded workload holds them back to reflect. The wellbeing and care for the children are higher
                prioritized
                then personal development</li>
              <li>The intrinsic motivation is that they're driven and passionate about their job</li>
              <li>To be able to reflect properly, its most effective to analyze through voice recordings or videos</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="alinea">
          <h3>Benefits of reflecting</h3>
          <p>In order to develop in their workfield, CP social workers reflect on their actions after events. These
            events
            consist of supervisions or counsels with families. Reflection allows them to plan, articulate, evaluate
            and learn in the complex issues that they face daily. The importance of reflecting, is to breakdown and
            critically analyze the processes that occur in decision making in child protection. This leads to develop a
            sense of what has achieved, what is likely to be achieved and could be done better. Resulting to provide
            better help for the child and the family.</p>

          <p>How can I help CP social workers gaining insights on their learning points through a digital interactive
            application, in order to efficiently take care of their development process. As a result, knowing what to
            tackle in their own development.</p>

          <p>Reflecting by using only text input seems ineffective, since you have to go through every highlight looking

            emoticons.</p>

          <h6>End result</h6>
          <p>After conducted tests, iterations and more tests, I discoverd that the technique behind the concept seemed
            more harder
            to realise than I thought. There were some questionmarks about the heart rythm variation. One test showed
            there's a possible chance that the measures can deviate, because high tensions doens't always define a
            troubled situation. Despite the technique, tests and validation showed that the concept indeed does raise
            the ability for CP social workers to start reflecting structurally.</p>
